    "This is a compilation of data from several behavioral economics experiments where people play various games like the [Prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) or [Stag Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt). \n",

    "To contribute to this [database](https://github.com/polomsca/one-shot-games/blob/master/gamesmxn.csv), you can submit any experiment with games that are two-player, one-shot, and normal-form, like so:\n",
