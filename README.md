# One-shot games

## Overview

This is a compilation of data from several behavioral economics experiments where people play various games like the [Prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) or [Stag Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stag_hunt). 

To contribute to this [database](https://github.com/polomsca/one-shot-games/blob/master/gamesmxn.csv), you can submit any experiment with games that are one-shot (no finitely repeated or "second-mover" games) and in matrix form (also known as bimatrix, normal, or strategic). Please use the following format:

`paper` | `game` | `matrixrow` | `matrixcol` | `choicerow` | `choicecol` | `shape` | `symmetric` | `repeats` | `subjects` 
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
stahlwilson1994 | 1 | 40 10 70; 20 80 0; 30 100 60 | | 11 40; 0 40; 29 40 | | 3 3 | 1 | | 40

A couple notes on formatting:

- `matrixrow` : The payoff matrix for the row player. In each row, separate elements with a space. Separate rows with semicolons. This lets `numpy.matrix()` return a matrix with the correct dimensions.
- `matrixcol` : If the game is symmetric and the player results are pooled, you may leave this field blank.
- `choicerow` : The frequency of each choice for the row player. If frequencies are represented as fractions, separate integers with a space, not a forward slash. Separate choices with a semicolon. 
- `choicecol` : If the game is symmetric, and the player results are pooled, you may leave this field blank.
- `symmetric` : `1` if symmetric, `0` otherwise.
- `repeats` : Entries of other games that have identical payoff matrices.

This is also a collection of [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) models that attempt to predict how people make decisions in these games. To contribute to this collection, you can submit any relevant models or papers.

## Footnotes

[<a name="myfootnote1">1</a>] Appendix D, Game 10 is printed incorrectly as

`12` | `63` | `22` 
--- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | 38 
55 | 25 | 40 
35 | 35 | 43 

Game 10 should be read instead as

`0` | `12` | `63` 
--- | --- | ---
25 | 0 | 0
0 | 55 | 25 
100 | 35 | 35
